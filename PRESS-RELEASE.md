There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

<h1>Backbone Visualizer (Spinal Cord)</h1>

<h3>Sub-Heading</h3>
Visualizes a Backbone.js web application for new employees jumping onto a project


<h3> Summary </h3>
Backbone Visualizer is a tool to help visualize the model-view-controller design paradigm used in Backbone.js. This benefits web developers by producing a visual representation of the MVC pattern used in a certain web application.

<h3> Problem </h3>
Trying to understand a Backbone app is a daunting task, for experienced and non-experienced engineer alike; especially when the app is large and it is not always clear where you should look for information. 

<h3> Solution </h3>
We want to change that by graphically depict the stack to instancely give user a better understanding of the app and aid in the tracking of the functions/data. The models and views will be represent as boxes that contain functions and data. There will be arrows pointing for each time these data get pass from one box to another, also when a function or data is clicked, we will highlight the whole “chain” of arrow to isolate and direct the user to where they should look for information

<h3> How to Get Started </h3>
Import your whole directory and let the program map it out for you.

<h3> Closing and Call to Action </h3>
Save time and bring your new employee up to date with Backbone Visualizer
